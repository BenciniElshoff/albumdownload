# Album Download

Album Download is a Chrome extension that is available from the Chrome Web Store. After a generous free trial, it costs about a cup of coffee per year. I built it because I store all my photos in Google Photos and I wanted easier ways to share my photos.

### Features
- Download all media items (photos and videos) in an album and preserve order.
- Download more shareable formats. The iPhone heic images are downloaded as jpg images and the mov videos as mp4 videos.
- Able to specify the media item naming.
- Able to download resized and cropped copies.
